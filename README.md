iamsafe
=======

Android app that tells you if you are in a safe location or not.

The idea is to get the current location from GPS and use to information to find out whether the location is safe.

Determining if a location is safe is done using data available. (Basicially an algorithm that cruches some data and recommends if it is safe).

##### Stuff to do
* Give a proper name
* Improve readme
* Decide on tech stack
* Build the actual app
